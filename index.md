* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite because it was the very first time I began and started coding and it was quite an experience. The Lab required me to write a very simple code, however during that time, I honestly had a fair bit of confusion and struggle to it as I was just introduced to coding. First, I had to write a header, which stated my name as well as my partner's names, then delcare a statement that wrote an introduction of our names.

* Lab 4 

    Lab 4, Part 2 was a favorite because of two reasons: the concept behind creating a number guessing game seemed interesting and fun, and I was able to meet a new friend, which was my partner for this lab. I was required to create a series of statements that printed out the requirements and instructions for the game, then create if statements in order for the game to operate functionally. My partner and I struggled a fair amount, which strengthened our relationship and we both had fun coding the lab and it was extremely satisfying, being able to play the finished product of our code.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, Part 1 and Part 2 was a favorite it was up to that point, one of the hardest labs I had to do. Part 1, was not that bad, which required me to write a command line for Mad Lib, which is a word game that involves sentences with blanks that require players to fill in those blanks. However, Part 2 was a whole different rodeo. Part 2 required a lot of coding, as well as knowlegde on blackjack, which I have never played in my life, so learning it was also a struggle and took a while. Basically, Part 2 had me recreate the game of blackjack using functions and statements for instructions.
